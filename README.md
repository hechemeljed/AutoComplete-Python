# AutoComplete

- This is a small Python challenge:

This class is called Autocomplete. It has a constructor that receives a list called word_list that contains all the known words in lowercase. The class has a find function that receives a string called pattern and returns a list with all the possible words that start with the given pattern. If no word is found, then return null.
